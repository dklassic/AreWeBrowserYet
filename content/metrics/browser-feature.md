This page will be automatically built every week showing the status of supported browser feature.

The data is generated using json file retreived by running latest servo build through local instance of [mdn-bcd-collector](https://mdn-bcd-collector.gooborg.com/) which performs browser feature detection, and will then be compared with [mdn's browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) to link relevant specs.
