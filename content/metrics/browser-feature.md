This page will be automatically built every week showing the status of supported browser feature.

The data is generated using json file retreived by running latest Servo commit through a local instance of [mdn-bcd-collector](https://mdn-bcd-collector.gooborg.com/) which performs browser feature detection. Which is then compared against [chromestatus's web features list](https://chromestatus.com/metrics/webfeature/popularity) to rank it by popularity.

The full test results can be accessed [here](@/metrics/browser-feature-full.md)
