This page will be automatically built every week showing the status of supported CSS features in [Stylo](https://github.com/servo/stylo), the styling system of Servo.

The data is generated using json file provided by [chromestatus](https://chromestatus.com/metrics/css/popularity#variable) which collects the most used css properties via Chrome's anonymous usage statistics, which will then be compared with [`Stylo`'s supported css properties](https://doc.servo.org/stylo/css-properties.html).

Additional links to relevant specs are provided by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).
