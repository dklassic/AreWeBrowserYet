This page will be automatically built every week showing the status of supported browser feature.

The data is generated using json file retreived by running latest Servo commit through a local instance of [mdn-bcd-collector](https://mdn-bcd-collector.gooborg.com/) which performs browser feature detection. Then relevant links of specs will be retrieved through [mdn's browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data).
